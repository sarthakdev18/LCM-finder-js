In the above program, the user is prompted to enter two positive integers.
The greater number among the numbers provided by the user is stored in a min variable. The LCM of two numbers cannot be less than the greater number.

The while loop is used with an if statement. In each iteration,

  1. The variable min is divided by both the num1 and num2.
  2. If both numbers' remainders are equal to 0, then it is the LCM and the break statement terminates the program.
  3. If both numbers' remainders are not equal to 0, the value of min is increased by 1 and the loop continues.
  4. The while loop continues until the condition is met.
